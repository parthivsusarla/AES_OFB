=== AES-128 OFB Mode Report ===

Security Analysis:
- Block Dependencies: OFB is a stream cipher mode. Each keystream block is generated by encrypting the previous keystream block (starting from IV). Thus, keystream blocks are dependent on prior ones, but not on plaintext or ciphertext.
- IV/Nonce Usage: Requires a unique, unpredictable 128-bit IV for each encryption under the same key. Reusing an IV with the same key leaks plaintext (via XOR of ciphertexts).
- Error Propagation: Bit errors in ciphertext affect only the corresponding bit in plaintext. No error propagation occurs; synchronization is preserved.
